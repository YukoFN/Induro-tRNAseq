		# Functions for organizing outputs from mimseq
		a. Summary table of RTstop, misincorporation, & readthrough proportions at individual position for each isoacceptor
		b. Summary table for heatmap of misincorporation and RTStop
		c. Add info of annotated tRNA modificartions in Nedialkova's paper
		d. Summary table of RTstop & misincorporation proportions at modification sites
		e. Proportion of read identity (A,T,G,C) at annotated modifications with upstream and downstream base info


		# Functions for figures
		0. Mapping rate
		1. 3'-CCA end analysis
		2. Differential abundance analysis
		3. Heatmap of misincorporation & RTstop
		4. Comparison of readthrough proportion at annotated modification sites between two samples
		5. Context-dependency of read identity
		6. RTstop and misincorporation in individual tRNA isoacceptor
		7. Read identity at specific site (ex. position 37 in tRNAPro(AGG))
